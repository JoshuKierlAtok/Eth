MyToken Contract

This is a smart contract for the MyToken token (referred to as ATK). It allows for minting and burning of tokens, as well as tracking balances for different addresses.

Public Variables

name: A string variable representing the name of the token (ATOK).
symbol: A string variable representing the symbol of the token (ATK).
totalSupply: An unsigned integer variable representing the total supply of tokens.

Mapping Variable

balances: A mapping that associates an address with its corresponding token balance.

Functions

mint(address _address, uint _value): A function used to mint new tokens. It increases the total supply and adds the specified number of tokens to the balance of the given address.

burn(address _address, uint _value): A function used to burn (destroy) tokens. It checks if the specified address has enough tokens to burn, reduces the total supply, and subtracts the specified number of tokens from the address balance.

Please note that this readme file provides a brief overview of the MyToken contract and its functionalities. For more detailed information, it is recommended to review the actual code implementation.

Note:

 Make sure to review and test the code thoroughly before deploying it on a live network.
